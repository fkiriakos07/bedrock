  </header>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Mozilla Bug Bounty Program is designed to encourage security research into Mozilla's websites and services and to reward those who find unique and original bugs in our web infrastructure.</p>

  <p><strong>We have migrated our web bug bounty program to HackerOne.</strong> Please visit our policy pages to learn more and to submit reports. <a href="https://hackerone.com/mozilla_critical_services">Mozilla Critical Services</a> and <a href="https://hackerone.com/mozilla_core_services">Mozilla Core Services</a></p>

  <p><strong>Guidelines:</strong> Submissions must conform to our <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty') }}">general eligibility requirements</a></p>

  <p>Please submit all bug reports via our <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty.faq-webapp') }}#bug-reporting">secure bug reporting process</a>.</p>
